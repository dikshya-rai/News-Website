                <p>Police in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata have fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of protesters demanding justice for the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at a state-run hospital earlier this month.
                    The discovery of the body of the 31-year-old sparked nationwide outrage over the crisis of violence against women.
                    On Tuesday, thousands marched to a government building in Kolkata, demanding the resignation of West Bengal's Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee.
                    A hospital volunteer has been arrested in connection with the crime, which has now been handed over to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after criticism of the local police's slow progress.

                <p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are set to square off in their first presidential debate next month, but the campaigns are still warring over logistics - namely relating to the microphones.
                    Trump's campaign is pushing for the microphones to be muted when it is the other person's turn to speak. This is a rule that was originally requested by Joe Biden when he was the Democratic candidate.
                    Trump's team ultimately agreed to the request - which was an apparent effort by Biden's campaign to limit interruptions. (The pair's chaotic first 2020 debate was marred by constant interruptions, with Mr Biden eventually snapping at his rival: "Will you shut up, man?")
                    Some analysts say the Trump campaign's eagerness to keep the muting rule in place for the Harris debate on 10 September may be due to the positive reception he received for what was a more reserved performance than many had anticipated against Mr Biden in June.

                <p>Acting Chief of the Nepal Army Ashok Sigdel has been appointed as the Chief of Army Staff on Wednesday. His appointment will take effect from September 9.

                    President Ramchandra Paudel appointed Sigdel to the position as per Article 267 (5) of the constitution, following the recommendation of the Council of Ministers, according to a statement issued by Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, the spokesperson for the Office of the President.
                    
                    Current Chief of Army Staff Prabhu Ram Sharma has been on a month-long leave since August 8 as per the mandatory retirement. Following the tradition of the Nepal Army, Sharma will hand over responsibilities to Sigdel on September 9. Sigdel will serve as Chief of Army Staff for three years, until August 9, 2027.
